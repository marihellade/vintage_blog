# Implementation Journal

## Phase 1 — Stabilise and remove drag

### Intent
Phase 1 removed a few high-impact sources of drag without changing the site's personality: slower font delivery, missing keyboard skip navigation, heading hierarchy skips, a dead cursor asset, and style documentation that no longer matched the live implementation.

### Work completed
- Moved Google Fonts loading out of `src/styles/global.css` and into the document head in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` with `preconnect` links and a reduced font variant set
- Added a keyboard-accessible skip link at the top of the layout body and global styling for its hidden and focused states
- Repaired `h1` to `h2` hierarchy across the homepage, About page, travel and recipe indexes, and the book detail page panels
- Removed the unused `public/cursors/sprig.svg` asset
- Updated `docs/style-notes.md` to reflect the current dark base, warm-gold sparkle treatment, and the accepted cursor direction

### Validation
- Ran `npm run build` before changes to confirm the baseline build was green
- Ran `npm run build` after each major implementation slice and again during final acceptance
- Checked generated HTML in `dist/` for the font stylesheet link and the skip link
- Confirmed the old `section-title` and `panel-title` `h3` patterns were gone from the updated source
- Confirmed `public/cursors/sprig.svg` was removed

### Git
- Branch: `fix/phase1-stabilise`
- Key commits:
  - `7907155` `fix: move font loading into layout head`
  - `645fc9c` `fix: repair heading hierarchy across pages`
  - `7079272` `chore: remove sprig asset and sync style notes`
- Merge result: merged into `main` with `merge: complete phase 1 stabilise`

### Notes
- `npx astro check` is not yet available in the repo because `@astrojs/check` is not installed; that stays aligned with the roadmap and will be addressed in a later phase
- The working tree still contains unrelated pre-existing local edits in `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.gitignore`; they were left untouched

## Phase 2 — Content architecture completion

### Intent
Phase 2 gave the travel and recipe collections the same scalable shape as the books collection: lightweight index pages for browsing, dedicated detail routes for full entries, and documentation that explains the new authoring flow clearly.

### Work completed
- Added `src/pages/travel/[slug].astro` with a static path per travel entry and a full detail layout for destination, date, mood, highlights, tags, and markdown body
- Reworked `src/pages/travel/index.astro` from inline markdown rendering to linked summary cards with thumbnails, metadata, highlight previews, and entry links
- Added `src/pages/recipes/[slug].astro` with a static path per recipe entry and a full detail layout for source, rating, make-again status, tags, and markdown body
- Reworked `src/pages/recipes/index.astro` into linked summary cards and aligned recipe star rendering with the shared rating helper
- Updated `docs/how-to-edit-content.md` so it now explains that travel and recipe entries automatically create both an index card and an individual page

### Validation
- Ran `npm run build` after the travel slice, after the recipe slice, after the docs update, and again in the final acceptance pass
- Verified the build now generates `/travel/sample-trip/` and `/recipes/rosemary-focaccia/`
- Confirmed the travel and recipe index pages no longer call `render()` for inline entry bodies
- Confirmed the built index pages link to the new detail routes

### Git
- Branch: `feature/travel-recipe-detail-pages`
- Key commits:
  - `2211652` `feat: add travel detail pages`
  - `6e06e02` `feat: add recipe detail pages`
  - `e99fbf6` `docs: update content editing guide`
- Merge result: merged into `main` with `merge: complete phase 2 content architecture`

### Notes
- The phase intentionally kept the homepage feature cards unchanged; the roadmap only required the travel and recipe collection architecture to be completed
- The same unrelated pre-existing local edits in `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.gitignore` remain untouched

## Phase 3 — Astro upgrade

### Intent
Phase 3 moved the project onto a current Astro release while preserving the existing content authoring flow, route structure, and static output.

### Work completed
- Upgraded Astro from `4.16.0` to `6.1.3`
- Added `@astrojs/check` and `typescript` so the repo can run Astro’s type and diagnostics pass
- Enabled the official temporary `legacy.collectionsBackwardsCompat` flag so the existing `src/content/config.ts` file and collection setup continue to work during the upgrade
- Updated `src/content/config.ts` to import `z` from `astro/zod`
- Added the official Astro TypeScript `include` and `exclude` guidance to `tsconfig.json`
- Migrated collection entry usage from `entry.slug` and `entry.render()` to `render(entry)` plus clean slug generation based on entry IDs
- Added `src/utils/contentSlug.ts` to preserve the existing clean URLs after Astro 6’s path-based legacy entry IDs introduced `.md` suffixes
- Updated `README.md` and `docs/how-to-run.md` to note the new Node.js `22.12.0+` requirement

### Validation
- Ran `npx astro check` after the compatibility fixes and in the final acceptance pass; result: `0 errors`
- Ran `npm run build` after the upgrade work and in the final acceptance pass; result: passed
- Verified generated routes remained clean and extension-free:
  - `/books/...`
  - `/travel/sample-trip`
  - `/recipes/rosemary-focaccia`

### Git
- Branch: `chore/astro-upgrade`
- Key commits:
  - `22bdeaf` `chore: upgrade astro to v6`
  - `51fe7f1` `fix: adapt collection routes for astro v6`
  - `8de0632` `docs: note astro 6 node requirement`
- Merge result: merged into `main` with `merge: complete phase 3 astro upgrade`

### Notes
- Astro 6 still reports non-blocking hints in `src/pages/books/index.astro` and a deprecation hint for `z.string().url()` in `src/content/config.ts`; these did not block `astro check` or the build
- The same unrelated pre-existing local edits in `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.gitignore` remain untouched
